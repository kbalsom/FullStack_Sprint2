    When a user enters a search term, we want to search for it through all categories.
		For example, if the user searches for "2000" it will return all movies released in
		the year 2000, but also any movies with "2000" in the title.

		Since all our year values are integers, we need to search for them as integers - but
		since the other fields are strings we don't want to search for them as integers.
		Therefore, just for the year field, we just check if the search term is a number or
		not, and if it is, we convert it to an integer. In mongo this works because types are
		not enforced when querying, so even if we pass a string to a field that is an integer,
		it will still work as intended and not throw an error. For postgreSQL we'll handle
		this a little differently.
